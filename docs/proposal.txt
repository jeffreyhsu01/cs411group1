Idea 1: 
Our first web application idea is an application for swapping clothes using a matching algorithm.
Users can post clothes/accessories that they don't like anymore and can also see a feed of other users' clothes.
There would be a like and unlike feature, where after an action prompts another piece of clothing/accessory. 
If two users like each other's clothing, it is a match and the two can start communicating/exchange the items.
For this appliaction we plan on making it progressive and implementing a user login using third-party auth. 
We've looked into the Tinder API and Google Maps API to develop the matching feature. 
For deployment it's still preliminary but we are contemplating using one of Heroku, Expo, or AWS.
