Idea Proposal: 
Our web application idea is called "Project Swap" and is an application for swapping clothes using a matching algorithm.
Users can post clothes/accessories that they don't want anymore and can also see a feed of other users' clothes.
There would be a like and unlike feature so the user can input which clothing pieces or accessories they're interested in. Then, the next item appears. 
If two users like each other's items, it is a match and the two can start communicating then exchange in person.
For this application we plan on making it progressive and implementing a user login using Google OAuth. 
We've looked into the Tinder API and Google Maps API/MapBox GL to develop the matching feature.
For our architecture, it'll be decoupled with a React frontend and a Firebase backend.
For deployment it's still preliminary but we are contemplating using one of Heroku, Expo, or AWS.
